        <h1>Let me introduce myself</h1>

        <p>
          My name is Belén Alonso. Since I was young, I have been fascinated by
          creativity and the ability to bring ideas to life through design. With
          that background in design and a budding interest in development, I
          embarked on a journey into the technology sector with a sense of
          curiosity and determination. <br />

          My story in the technology sector is a testament to my determination
          to achieve my goals and challenge my own limits. Although I find
          myself in the early stages of my career in development, my enthusiasm
          and commitment are unwavering. <br />
          With every line of code I write and every design I visualize, I strive
          to merge aesthetics and functionality harmoniously. I am determined to
          test my skills and learn from every challenge I encounter on this
          exciting journey. <br />

          My goal is not only to master the tools and technologies of
          development, but also to leave a significant mark through my
          creations. I am ready to fully immerse myself in this dynamic and
          thrilling world, and I am eager to demonstrate what I am capable of
          achieving. <br />
          I am excited for what the future holds in this exciting journey of
          development and design!
